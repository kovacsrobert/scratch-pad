! needs a JSP engine, i.e, a container to process JSP pages
	- Apache which has built-in JSP container to support JSP pages development

Steps:
	1. Normal HTTP request
	2. The web server recognizes that the HTTP request is for a JSP page (request ends with .jsp instead of .html)
	3. The JSP engine loads the JSP page from disk and converts it into a servlet content
	4. The JSP engine compiles the servlet into an executable class and forwards the original request to a servlet engine
	5. Servlet engine loads the Servlet class and executes it, the output (HTML format) passed on to the web server inside an HTTP response
	6. Web server forwards the HTTP response to your browser
	7. Web browser handles the dynamically-generated HTML page inside the

Highlight from steps:
	- Translation phase: Done by the JSP engine. Contains 3 steps: reading the JSP file, generating the java and compiling it into a class (these steps are not executed for all requests)
	- Request processing phase: Done by the servlet engine. Executing the class file and generating the output HTML
	- JSP engine (JSP container): Provides environment for the JSP to execute (Translation phase)
	- Servlet engine (Servlet container): Provides environment for a Servlet to execute (Request processing phase)

Notes for steps:
	- The JSP engine checks to see whether a servlet for a JSP file already exists and whether the modification date on the JSP is older than the servlet (not always generate java class)
	- Except for the translation phase, a JSP page is handled exactly like a regular servlet
	? JSP container must support Servlet, these 2 are interchangable terms in JSP

JSP lifecycle:
	- Compilation: parse JSP, create java servlet, compile java servlet
	- Initialization: performed only once, invokes jspInit() method
	- Execution: represents all interactions with requests until the JSP is destroyed, invokes _jspService(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) method
	- Cleanup: JSP is being removed from use by a container, invokes jspDestroy() method

Servlet Lifecycle (for comparison):
	- Initialization
	- Request lifecycle / Main logic
	- Shutdown

Elements of JSP:
	- Scriptlet: A scriptlet can contain any number of JAVA language statements, variable or method declarations, or expressions that are valid in the page scripting language.
		- syntax: <% ... %> or <jsp:scriptlet>...</jsp:scriptlet>
	- Declaration: A declaration declares one or more variables or methods that you can use in Java code later in the JSP file.
		- syntax: <%! ... %> or <jsp:declaration>...</jsp:declaration>
